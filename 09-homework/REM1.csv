Birds and snakes, an aeroplane, Lenny Bruce is not afraid
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needsFeed it up a knock, speed, grunt, no, strength, no
Ladder, structure clatter with fear of height, down height
Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
In a government for hire and a combat siteLeft her, wasn't coming in a hurry with the furies
Breathing down your neck
Team by team, reporters baffled, trump, tethered crop
Look at that low plane, fine thenUh oh, overflow, population, common group
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
Tell me with the rapture and the reverent in the right, right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psychedIt's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fineSix o'clock, TV hour, don't get caught in foreign tower
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
Lock him in uniform and book burning, blood letting
Every motive escalate, automotive incinerateLight a candle, light a motive, step down, step down
Watch a heel crush, crush, uh oh, this means no fear
Cavalier, renegade and steer clear
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I declineIt's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine, I feel fineIt's the end of the world as we know it

It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fineThe other night I tripped a nice continental drift divide
Mount St. Edelite, Leonard Bernstein
Leonid Breshnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam but neck, right? RightIt's the end of the world as we know it

It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it upThat's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enoughI thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you tryEvery whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it upConsider this
Consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around
Now I've said too muchI thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you tryBut that was just a dream
That was just a dreamThat's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enoughI thought that I heard you laughing

there isn't a number. you can call the pay phone.
let it ring a long, long, long, long time.
if i don't pick up, hang up, call back, let it ring some more.
if i don't pick up, pick up... the sidewinder sleeps, sleeps, sleeps in a coil
Call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
There are scratches all around the coin slot
like a heartbeat, baby trying to wake up,
but this machine can only swallow money.
you can't lay a patch by computer design.
it's just a lot of stupid, stupid signs.
Tell her,
tell her she can kiss my ass, then laugh and say that you were only kidding.
that way she'll know that it's really, really, really, really me.
Call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.Baby, instant soup doesn't really grab me.
today i need something more sub-sub-sub-substantial.
a can of beans or blackeyed peas, some nescafe and ice,
a candy bar, a falling star, or a reading of doctor seuss;
Call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
The cat in the hat came back, wrecked a lot of havoc on the way,
always had a smile and a reason to pretend.
but their world has flat backgrounds and little need to sleep but to dream.
the sidewinder sleeps on his back.
Call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
i can always sleep standing up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
i can always sleep standing up. call me when you try to wake her.
call me when you try to wake her up. call me when you try to wake her.
i can always sleep standing up. call me when you try to wake her.
i can always sleep standing up. call me when you try to wake her.
We've got to moogie, moogie, move on this one."

Turned around backwards so the windshield shows
Every street light reveals a picture in reverse
Still its so much clearerI forgot my shirt at the water's edge
The moon is low tonightNightswimming deserves a quiet night
I'm not sure all these people understandIt's not like years ago
The fear of getting caught
The recklessness in water
They cannot see me naked
These things they go away
Replaced by every dayNightswimming, remembering that night
September's coming soon
I'm pining for the moon
And what if there were two
Side by side in orbit around the fairest sun?
That bright tight forever drum
Could not describe nightswimmingYou, I thought I knew you
You, I can not judge
You, I thought you knew me
This one laughing quietly
Underneath my breath
NightswimmingThe photograph reflects
Every street light a reminder
Nightswimming
Deserves a quiet night
Deserves a quiet night"

Freezing in the corner
Trying to look like you don't tryThat sugarcane that tasted good
That's cinnamon, that's Hollywood
Come on, come on
No one can see you try(No one can see you cry)That sugarcane that tasted good
That's freezing rain, that's what you could
Come on, come on
No one can see you cryThis sugarcane, this lemonade
This hurricane, I'm not afraid
Come on, come on
No one can see me cry
This lightning storm, this tidal wave
This avalanche, I'm not afraid
Come on, come on
No one can see me cryThat sugarcane that tasted good
That's who you are, that's what you could
Come on, come on
No one can see you cryThat sugarcane that tasted good

Birds and snakes, an aeroplane, Lenny Bruce is not afraid
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needsFeed it up a knock, speed, grunt, no, strength, no
Ladder, structure clatter with fear of height, down height
Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
In a government for hire and a combat siteLeft her, wasn't coming in a hurry with the furies
Breathing down your neck
Team by team, reporters baffled, trump, tethered crop
Look at that low plane, fine thenUh oh, overflow, population, common group
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
Tell me with the rapture and the reverent in the right, right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psychedIt's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fineSix o'clock, TV hour, don't get caught in foreign tower
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
Lock him in uniform and book burning, blood letting
Every motive escalate, automotive incinerateLight a candle, light a motive, step down, step down
Watch a heel crush, crush, uh oh, this means no fear
Cavalier, renegade and steer clear
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I declineIt's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine, I feel fineIt's the end of the world as we know it

It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fineThe other night I tripped a nice continental drift divide
Mount St. Edelite, Leonard Bernstein
Leonid Breshnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam but neck, right? RightIt's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it

You know that's not my thingYou came to bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Blame, blame, blame
You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
It's not my thing so let it go, nowYou've got a little worry,
I know it all too well,
I've got your number,
But so does every kiss-and-tell
Who dares to cross your threshold,
Or happens on your way,
Stop laying blame
You know that's not my thingYou know that's not my thing,
You came to bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Blame, blame, blame
You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
It's not my thing so let it go
You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Blame, blame, blame
You bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
It's not my thing so let it goYou kiss on me, tug on me, 
rub on me, jump on me,
You bang on me, beat on me, 
hit on me, let go on me,
You let go on me"

And suddenly you wake up
In a shaking panic, nowYou set me up like a lamb to slaughter

Unbelievable the gospel according to who

Hum my name and flair their nostrils
Choking on the bones you toss to themI'm not one to sit and spin
'Cos living well is the best revenge
Baby, I am calling you on thatTry turn your talking points on me
History will set me free
The future's ours and you don't even read
The footnote nowSo who's chasing me? Where did you go?
You disappear mid sentence sinner
In a judgment crisis I see my anecdote fall out
You weakened shellAll you sad and lost apostles
Hum my name and flair their nostrils
Choking on the bones you toss to themI'm not one to sit and spin
'Cos living well's the best revenge
Baby, I am calling you on thatYou say it with your dying breath
Well I forgive but I don't forget
You work it out, let's hear that argument
Count the count of three go, nowAll you sad and lost apostles
Hum my name and flair their nostrils
Choking on the bones you toss to themWell I'm not one to sit and spin

Seahorses if we were in the sea.Halfway from coal, halfway to diamond.
My fall knocked a mean chip out of me.I'm gathering as far as I can reach
We're perched upon the precipice
And this is what I've seen.This is all I want it's all I need
This is all I am it's everything
This is all I want it's all I need.A bluejay hectors from the felled Catalpa tree
A doctorate in science and a theologian's dream.The dragonflies are trying to lecture me
Seahorses if we were in the sea.This is all I want it's all I need
This is all I am it's everything
This is all I want it's all I need.Beat a drum for me, like a butterfly wing
Tropical storm across the ocean.Don't explain, I'm sure I'll want to know.
Don't forget, we're just halfway from coal.This is all I want it's all I need

In the final act of the beginning of time
Hyena, take your role, the stage is set
The town is safe again tonightHyena (I see the day ahead)
Hyena (and all that I've cried through)

Man, you serve communal interest
She'll tell you when and where and how and why you'd hurt
A beautiful young ladyHyena (I see the day ahead)
Hyena (and all that I've cried through)
Hyena (God knows you're doing that, don't you)The only thing to fear is fearlessness
The bigger the weapon, the greater the fear

Meager pay, but recognition
Hyena crawls on his belly out
The town is safe again tonightHyena (I see the changes, man)

These heavy notions creep around
It makes me think long ago
I was brought into this life a little lamb, a little lamb
Courageous, stumbling
Fearless was my middle name
But somewhere there I lost my way
Everyone walks the same
Expecting me to step
The narrow path they've laidThey claim to walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me highSay ""Keep within the boundaries if you want to play""
Say ""Contradiction only makes it harder""
How can I be what I want to be?
When all I want to do is strip away
These stilled constraints
And crush this charade
Shred this sad masquerade
I don't need no persuading
I'll trip, fall, pick myself upAnd walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me highIf I have a bag of rocks to carry as I go
I just want to hold my head up high
I don't care what I have to step over
I'm prepared to look you in the eye
Look me in the eye
And if you see familiarity
Then celebrate the contradiction
Help me when I fallTo walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high
Walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
Hold my love me or leave me high"

The wise man built his words upon the rocks

Disguised as they know what I made I feel it

Took you up and away from this place and sheer humiliation
Of your teenage station
Nobody cares no one remembers or caresNo one cares if your fantasies are
Dressed up in travesties
Enjoy yourself with no regrets
Two, three, fourIf you call out safe then I'll stop right away
If the premise explode and the world starts to shake
For the details great
With the stories the same
You don't have to explain
You don't have to explain
Humiliation

Dressed up in travesties
Enjoy yourself with no regretsEverybody here comes from somewhere
If they would just as soon forget,

Disguised as they know what I feel I feel it

No one saw your face, no one saw your fear
If that apparition had just appeared
Took you up and away from this place and sheer humiliation
Of your teenage station
A celebration Of your teenage station

Across the seat
And jumped out the passenger side.
The only thing worth looking for
Is what you find inside.
But that had not yet appeared.
Lost, invisible, here.
Tel Aviv and Agadir,
Taroudant and Olomouc
Before I learned to see
The vanishing point appear.I looked for you and everywhere.
I looked for you and everywhere.There is a calm I haven't come to yet
I spend half my life figuring what comes next.
I telescoped in.
I'll finally win,
I'll finally win the prize.
That now my eyes see
A comic's perfect timing squeezed.
I'm headfirst fighting everything
The crushed force of memory
Erasing all I've been
The vanishing point appears.I looked for you and everywhere.
I looked for you and everywhere.
Tell me why you're here
I came to disappear.Look at this face.
Can you believe it?
Am I living in a beautiful vacuum,
Because I can't see it.
The vanishing point appears.I looked for you and everywhere.
I looked for you and everywhere.
Tell me why you're here
I came to disappear
Tell me why you're here
I came to disappear
I came to disappear."

Courage built a bridge, jealousy tore it down

We sat in the garden, we stood on the porch
I won't deny myself, we never talkedShe wore bangles, she wore bells
On her toes and she jumped
Like a fish, like a flying friend
You were gone, like Kohoutek, can't forget that
Fever built a bridge, reason tore it down
If I am one to follow who will stand aloneMaybe you're not the problem, scissors, paper, stone
If you stand and holler, these prayers will talk
She carried ribbons, she wore them out
